## [0.1.0-beta] - 2025-10-24

### Added

#### Core Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Complete SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, UPSERT support
- **Type-Safe Scanning**: Reflection-based struct scanning with metadata caching
- **Query Builder**: Fluent API with method chaining for query construction
- **Multi-Database Support**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite dialects with proper placeholder handling

#### SELECT Operations
- `One()` - Query single row with type-safe scanning
- `All()` - Query multiple rows into slice
- Struct tag support (`db:"column_name"`)
- Nested struct scanning
- NULL value handling

#### INSERT Operations
- Simple INSERT with map values
- Batch INSERT with 3.3x performance improvement
- Multi-row INSERT support
- LastInsertId and RowsAffected support

#### UPSERT Operations
- PostgreSQL: `ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE`
- MySQL: `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`
- SQLite: `ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE`
- Conflict column specification
- Selective column updates
- DO NOTHING support

#### UPDATE Operations
- Single row UPDATE with WHERE conditions
- Batch UPDATE for multiple rows with different values
- Key-based batch updates
- 2.5x performance improvement for batch operations

#### DELETE Operations
- Simple DELETE with WHERE conditions
- Multiple condition support
- Safe deletion with explicit WHERE requirement

#### Transaction Support
- Full ACID transaction support
- All isolation levels: ReadUncommitted, ReadCommitted, RepeatableRead, Serializable
- Context propagation in transactions
- Automatic rollback on error
- Nested transaction detection

#### Performance Features
- **LRU Statement Cache**: Configurable capacity (default 1000)
- Cache hit latency: <60ns
- Thread-safe concurrent access
- Cache metrics: hit rate, evictions, size
- Zero allocations in hot paths

#### Context Support
- Context propagation throughout query chain
- Timeout support
- Cancellation support
- Transaction context auto-propagation
- `WithContext()` at any builder stage

#### Batch Operations
- **BatchInsert**: Multi-row INSERT, 3.3x faster than individual inserts
- **BatchUpdate**: Update multiple rows with different values, 2.5x faster
- Memory-efficient batch processing
- 55% fewer allocations

#### Documentation & Governance
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Comprehensive contribution guidelines with pre-commit checklist
- **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md**: Community standards (Contributor Covenant v2.1)
- **SECURITY.md**: Security policy and vulnerability reporting process
- **RELEASE_GUIDE.md**: Step-by-step release process documentation

#### Project Structure
- **Internal packages**: All implementation moved to `internal/` for clear API boundary
  - `internal/core/` - Query building logic
  - `internal/cache/` - Statement caching
  - `internal/dialects/` - SQL dialect implementations
  - `internal/util/` - Utility functions
- **Public API**: Only `github.com/coregx/relica` package is exposed
- **Pre-release automation**: Validation scripts for quality checks (`scripts/pre-release.sh`)

### Changed
- Replaced unbounded `sync.Map` with LRU cache to prevent memory leaks
- Improved error messages with context information
- Enhanced SQL generation for better readability
- Optimized struct metadata caching

### Removed
- OpenTelemetry dependency (replaced with NoOpTracer interface)
- Moved testcontainers to separate test module
- Zero production dependencies achieved

### Fixed
- Memory leak in statement cache
- Race conditions in concurrent cache access
- Context cancellation edge cases
- Transaction rollback safety

### Performance
- 3.3x faster batch INSERT (100 rows: 327ms vs 1094ms)
- 2.5x faster batch UPDATE (100 rows: 1370ms vs baseline)
- Sub-60ns statement cache hits
- 15% memory reduction in batch operations
- 55% fewer allocations in batch updates

### Documentation
- Comprehensive README.md with Quick Start guide
- Transaction implementation report
- UPSERT examples for all databases
- Batch operations guide
- API documentation with examples
- Performance benchmarks

### Testing
- 123+ unit tests
- Integration tests for all databases
- Benchmark suite
- 47.8% code coverage
- Separate test module for integration tests

### Security
- SQL injection protection via prepared statements
- Safe identifier quoting
- Input validation and sanitization
- Transaction isolation guarantees

## Architecture

### Zero Dependencies
- Production code uses only Go standard library
- Test dependencies isolated in separate module
- Pure Go SQLite driver for tests
- No external runtime dependencies

### Database Dialects
| Database | Placeholders | Identifiers | UPSERT Support |
|----------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| PostgreSQL | $1, $2, $3 | "users" | ON CONFLICT |
| MySQL | ?, ?, ? | \`users\` | ON DUPLICATE KEY |
| SQLite | ?, ?, ? | "users" | ON CONFLICT |

### Statement Caching
- Default capacity: 1000 prepared statements
- LRU eviction policy
- Thread-safe with RWMutex
- Performance metrics tracking
- Configurable capacity

## Requirements

- Go 1.25+
- Database drivers (runtime, not production dependency):
  - PostgreSQL: `github.com/lib/pq`
  - MySQL: `github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql`
  - SQLite: `modernc.org/sqlite` (pure Go)

## Migration Notes

This is the initial beta release. No migration required.

## Known Limitations

- Complex JOIN queries not yet supported (planned for v0.2.0)
- Query builder doesn't support subqueries (planned for v0.2.0)
- Raw SQL execution requires direct `db.DB()` access
- Limited aggregate function support
